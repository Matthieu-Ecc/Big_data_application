## Dependencies management

	pip install poetry
	poetry install
	
Poetry will install all the package store in the .toml

## Poetry function
### pyproject.toml
It contains the list of packages that we need in the virtual environment. 
In fact, it does the same thing as the "requirements.txt" file.

To add a package we will just make a shell command in the root of our project :
	`poetry add [package_name]`
	
And if you need to remove one :
	`poetry remove [package_name]`
### poetry.lock
If you don't want the latest version of your package or just an specific version you have to configure it here.
